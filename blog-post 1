      <!-- Tip 1 -->
      <div class="mb-16">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Focus on User Experience (UX)</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          In 2025, search engines like Google are placing greater emphasis on user experience (UX). Websites that provide an intuitive, fast, and mobile-friendly experience are more likely to rank higher in search results. Prioritize responsive design, quick loading times, and a seamless navigation experience to keep visitors engaged and reduce bounce rates.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Google’s focus on E-A-T has only intensified in recent years. In 2025, businesses must ensure that their content reflects expertise, authority, and trustworthiness.

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          With the rise of virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, optimizing your website for voice search is becoming increasingly important. Voice search queries are often more conversational, and websites that cater to these types of searches are more likely to rank higher. Incorporate long-tail keywords and focus on providing concise, relevant answers to common questions.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          AI is transforming SEO in 2025. Search engines are using AI to analyze content, understand user intent, and deliver more accurate search results. To stay ahead of the competition, businesses should leverage AI tools for keyword research, content creation, and performance analysis. Automation tools can also help streamline SEO tasks and improve efficiency.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Create High-Quality, Long-Form Content</h3>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Long-form content continues to dominate SEO in 2025. Search engines prioritize content that thoroughly covers topics, providing valuable information to users.
